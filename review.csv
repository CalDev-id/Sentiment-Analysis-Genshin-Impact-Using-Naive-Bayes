My experience so far has been wonderful. Great graphics, smooth gameplay and an all round decent gaming experience. My only issue is with the updates. Each time I update, I always have to re-download large data files of about 8 to 14 gb. Currently updating again while dropping this review. Would love it if that can be worked on.
